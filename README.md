## A Special Thank You To The Mod Developers

Without amazing mod developers that are willing to share their work so that we can have fun, there would be no mod packs as we know them, and there certainly would be no Betaworld. Thank you, [Alexmania](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/787282-alexmania/), [TTFTCUTS](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/2006370-ttftcuts/), [Calclavia](https://github.com/calclavia), [Mithion](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1460699-mithion/), [Nuchaz](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1265825-nuchaz/), [Mineshopper](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/473443-mineshopper/), [Dr.Zhark](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/86150-drzhark/), [Annysia](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/714477-annysia/), [SpaceToad](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/321873-spacetoad/), [micdoodle8](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/439942-micdoodle8/), [mDiyo](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/479012-mdiyo/), [MamiyaOtaru](http://www.planetminecraft.com/member/mamiyaotaru/), [BalkondeurAlpha](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/46318-balkondeuralpha/), and all other extended contributers that have made this fun place we call home, a reality.

Betaworld is built upon the work of others, and so it would not be right for us to accept donations. Instead, we encourage you to send donations directly to the authors of your favorite mods! They are the ones that did all of the really hard work, and they are the ones that your donations will be most appreciated by.

## Introduction

Betaworld is a unique modified minecraft experience in which players found sovereign nations, establish local governments, draft constitutions, sign treaties, vote in a global congress, get elected to important positions, grow their power, claim land, and build glorious monuments in their names!

Use a wide variety of magics, technologies, and cunning to tame this hostile world, it's moon, and even other dimensions populated by indigenous peoples, horrible monsters, dangerous wildlife, and fantastic wonders.

Good or Evil, Ancient or Modern, you can be and build what you wish on Betaworld. Whether you want to create a mystical temple, a stalwart medieval fortress, or a modern space command and science center; Betaworld has something for everybody.

This modpack is designed for our custom server and website (both open-source and also available here on GitHub) to provide unique socio-economic gameplay experiences, both in and out of game. It can be played single-player without problems, but is best experienced on our dedicated server, [LifeOnBetaworld.com](LifeOnBetaworld.com)

## Betaworld's Included Mods

We agree with MystCraft author [xcompwiz](http://binarymage.com/)'s conclusion that a modpack (and more broadly, a minecraft experience) should be more than the sum of it's parts.

To ensure that Betaworld never becomes "Just Another Modpack", and continues to always provide unique and wonderful gameplay, all mods and gameplay decisions must pass this litmus test:

1. Software May Only Be Used With The Permission Of Their Respective Owner(s).
2. Gameplay Changes Must Have A Reasonable Prospect For Fun.
3. Additions To Gameplay Must Homogenize With Current Gameplay Implementations.
4. Betaworld's gameplay remains focused upon it's socio-political meta-gameplay, and not on any particular mod's features.

### Biomes / Scenery

Betaworld aims to offer new sights & sounds, even in places where it is not expected. Exploration is best paired with Discovery, so we want to provide as much to discover while still maintaining a reasonably "natural" aesthetic.

* [Wild Caves](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1554854-16xforge-wildcaves-3-v0433/)
	* **Why Wild Caves?**
		* Because in vanilla Minecraft, all caves pretty much look the same, and we want to do something about that.
	* **License:**
		* "I don't mind my mod being part of a modpack as long as you don't use adf.ly (or the likes) for your modpack downloads, gives proper credits to the authors and have permission from them, has a link back to the mod page and sends me a PM asking first (and please, don't forget to include the name of the modpack and a link to it's page if it has one)." ~[Alexmania](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/787282-alexmania/)

* [Alternate Terrain Generation](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1932156-16x-atg-alternate-terrain-generation/)
	* **Why Alternate Terrain Generation?**
		* Because we want Betaworld to have as natural of a landscape as possible.
	* **License:**
		* "If you want to add ATG to a mod pack, then as long as it doesn't make money, that's fine by me. You don't need to ask permission, but it'd be nice (though not necessary) to drop me a message to say hi." ~[TTFTCUTS](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/2006370-ttftcuts/)
* [ExtraBiomesXL](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1090288-164-extrabiomesxl-3151/)
	* **Why ExtraBiomesXL**
		* Because it adds many new gorgeous biomes, while still being configurable enough to maintain a "natural" look.
	* **License:**
		* "You are free to distribute ExtrabiomesXL in your modpack." ~[Annysia](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/714477-annysia/)

### Building / Decoration

As the primary focus of Betaworld's gameplay is socio-economics/politics; building (and more specifically, building in a unique style) is a very important aspect of Nation Building. These mods provide sensible additions that impact the gameplay very little, while providing a huge variety of aesthetic options.

* [BiblioCraft](http://www.bibliocraftmod.com)
	* **Why BiblioCraft?**
		* Because Betaworld is a scholarly world full of writing, politics, and documents; we use Bibliocraft to provide furniture like bookshelves and tool racks to match the aesthetic of a functional world to our gameplay.
	* **License:**
		* "As long as you provide proper credit to me for my work(s) and have a link back to [www.bibliocraftmod.com](http://www.bibliocraftmod.com),  you can use my mod(s) in your mod pack." ~[Nuchaz](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1265825-nuchaz/)
* [Carpenter's Blocks](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1790919-1516forge-carpenters-blocks-v202-slopes-stairs-and-more/)
	* **Why Carpenter's Blocks?**
		* Because one of the primary activities on Betaworld is building, and we want more options regarding sloped blocks and aesthetics.
	* **License:**
		* "You're permitted to distribute this mod as part of a mod pack, whether for public or private use.  A link to this thread is all that is asked so users are able to understand how to use the mod." ~[Mineshopper](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/473443-mineshopper/)

### Wildlife / Mobs

Betaworld is teeming with life to be battled, exploited, and befriended. These mods provide the mobs and configuration needed to make the world seem alive, without negatively impacting gameplay seriously.

* [Custom Mob Spawner](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1080677-162-custom-mob-spawner/)
	* **Why Custom Mob Spawner?**
		* Because it's a requirement of Mo'Creatures, and it provides a means to customize how mobs spawn.
	* **License:**
		* Betaworld has secured a special arrangement with the mod author, [Dr.Zhark](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/86150-drzhark/), to feature his mods in our modpack.
* [Mo'Creatures](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/81771-172-mo-creatures-v620-with-ents-and-moles/)
	* **Why Mo'Creatures?**
		* Because it is the indisputable king of mob mods.
		* It is better designed, with more configuration options, and more support for other mods and resource packs than any other mob mod.
		* Because Dr.Zhark is awesome and allowed our project to use it! 
	* **License:**
		* Betaworld has secured a special arrangement with the mod author, [Dr.Zhark](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/86150-drzhark/), to feature his mods in our modpack.
* [Hardcore Ender Expansion](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1066990-hardcore-ender-expansion-v133-former-hardcore-enderdragon-mod-43000-dls/)
	* **Why Hardcore Ender Expansion?**
		* Because the End is a pretty boring place in vanilla.
		* This mod lets us make the End much more awesome.
	* **License:**
		* "You are allowed to: Add the mod into a modpack after you send me a private message with modpack name & mod list (private modpacks below 20 players don't need to)" ~[chylex](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/137233-chylex/)

### Weapons

With far more dangerous mobs, Betaworld needs measurably more powerful weapons. Weapon mods are chosen for their abilityt to provide balance against hostiles, without being so overpowered that mobs lose their relevance.

* [Balkon's WeaponMod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/211517-164forge-balkons-weaponmod-v113-now-with-flintlock-pistol/)
	* **Why Balkon's WeaponMod?**
		* Because the additional hostile wildlife provided by [Mo'Creatures](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/81771-172-mo-creatures-v620-with-ents-and-moles/) needed better weapons to balance gameplay.
		* Because we think the flintlocks provided by the mod are very sensible gun implementations that maintain the kind of balance we're looking for.
	* **License:**
		* "All private modpacks are free to use Balkon's WeaponMod without written permission, as long as they do not publish the pack or violate the terms and conditions as written in the readme file in the main download. Public modpacks should ask for permission from the original author and include a detailed desciption of the pack with the request. If you do not fulfill in these requirements, your request will be ignored." ~[BalkondeurAlpha](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/46318-balkondeuralpha/)

### Technology

All great nations are built upon a foundation of strong basic technologies. These mods provide basic protection and

* [Tinker's Construct](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1659892-164tinkers-construct/)
	* **Why Tinker's Construct?**
		* Because it offers low-level technology like metallurgy, which compliments all of the technology mods.
	* **License:**
		* "Modpacks are encouraged, feel free to do anything you like with it. I only ask that you enjoy it!" ~[mDiyo](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/479012-mdiyo/)

### Science

After mastering basic technologies, some players can choose to specialize in tech by utilizing gameplay from these science-based mods.

* [Atomic Science](http://calclavia.com/atomic-science/)
	* **Why Atomic Science?**
		* First, because we want space exploration as provided by [Galacticraft](http://micdoodle8.com/mods/galacticraft), and it makes sense that atomic science be available if space flight is available.
		* Second, because we want to provide a full scope of sensible science-based mods for fun and learning.
	* **License:**
		* "I, Calclavia, hereby give you revocable exclusive permission to use any of my mods (Atomic Science, Artillects, Basic Components, MFFS, Resonant Induction and ICBM) in your mod pack under the condition that you give me proper credit and a URL to the official download page." ~[Calclavia](https://github.com/calclavia)
* [BuildCraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/682920-164-buildcraft-421-blueprints-pipes-quarry-auto-crafting-building-engines/)
	* **Why BuildCraft?**
		* To provide mechanics, automation, and other useful types of technology for those that specialize in mechanics.
	* **License:**
		* "BuildCraft is open-source, and can be freely integrated." ~[SpaceToad](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/321873-spacetoad/)
* [Galacticraft](http://micdoodle8.com/mods/galacticraft)
	* **Why Galacticraft?**
		* Because we love the idea of our world being one of many.
		* Because we think this could lead to a framework where many overworlds could be traveled to and from.
	* **License:**
		* "Can I use this mod in a modpack? Sure, just make sure there's a cearly visible link to my site to the public as they download the mod." ~[micdoodle8](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/439942-micdoodle8/), Author of Galacticraft

### Magick

Magick and Technology are tools used by individuals to fulfill their political and national wishes.

* [Blood Magic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1899223-164-162-blood-magic-v072a-updated-jan-14/)
	* **Why Blood Magic?**
		* Because the dark-side of magic appeals to the darker souls of our server...
		* For real, though: It's a balanced mod providing a long-term path for dark magic, and Betaworld loves magic.
	* **License:**
		* "I love modpacks - I always have, and probably always will. You have my permission to include this mod in any form of modpack that you decide to put it in. If it is for a family server? Go ahead. Large public server? Be my guest. Publicly released full-fledged modpack? The more the merrier, but don't forget the popcorn! You can use this mod in any modpack, and you do not need to alert me to this. However, I do like to keep tabs on the communities to mainly fix bugs - the more mods that this mod is used with, the more likely there will be bugs. So, if you wish to include this, as a simple formality just let me know so that I can break out the champagne! If you are not legal, though, I suppose a bottle of soda water will suffice." ~[WayofTime](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/380961-wayoftime/)
* [Ars Magicka](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2028696-ars-magica-2-164-version-112b-updated-jan-27/)
	* **Why Ars Magicka?**
		* Because it's a well-designed, well-balanced magick mod that provides magick-loving players with an alternative to many technologies.
	* **License:**
		* "So here's the deal.  You want Ars Magica in your mod pack?  All you need to meet are three simple conditions: 1. Your mod pack needs a link back to this forum post. 2. You cannot make any money off of the mod pack. 3. You cannot claim that you made any part of the mod, and you must give credit to the author of the mod (Mithion) If these three conditions are met, then you have my permission to use it in a mod pack.  Have fun!" ~[Mithion](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1460699-mithion/)

### Utility

Some mods don't change Betaworld itself, but provide utility to the player. In rare cases, we fall in love with a utility mod, and add it here.

* [Zan's Minimap](http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/zans-minimap/)
    * **Why Zan's Minimap?** 
        * Because our world is full of dangerous monsters, and a minimap helps you to decide whether or not you'd like to engage.
        * Because we tried it out with, and without the map. We all think it's more fun with the minimap.
    * **Licensing:**
    	* "Using this mod in private modpacks is cool. Using it in public modpacks is fine if you provide credit and a link to this page and you do not make money from the pack (it isn't hosted behind adf.ly or anything like that)" ~[MamiyaOtaru](http://www.planetminecraft.com/member/mamiyaotaru/)
