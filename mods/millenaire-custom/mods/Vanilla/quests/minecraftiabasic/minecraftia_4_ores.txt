description_english:Now that you've learned about cooking with a furnace it's time to learn what else we can use it for. We're going to talk about smelting materials. Let's start with making charcoal so you don't ever run out of fuel. To make charcoal just burn any wood log in your furnace. Bring to me eight charcoal.
description_success_english:Glad you'll do it. You'll never run out of fuel.

description_english:Do you have the charcoal I asked for?
description_success_english:Very well, on to smelting materials. The first material to speak about is stone. I'm sure you have been mining out stone recently to get cobblestone for building and such. Well, you can take that cobblestone and refine it back into stone by smelting it in your furnace. Go do this and bring me eight stone.

description_success_english:Good. Now let's move on to a more complex material - glass. Glass is made by smelting sand. Carefull when digging out sand though, it could fall and crush you. Please bring me eight glass.

description_success_english:Very good. Now on to a rarer building material, clay. Clay can be found on the bottom of rivers. As such, be carefull when digging it up as you wouldn't want to drown now would you? Once you have some clay you'll have to smelt it into bricks. Find some clay and bring me eight bricks please.

description_success_english:Good job. Now your house will look amazing. Another thing you can do with clay is sculpt four balls of it into a block and then fire it in your furnace. This will give you some hardened clay. Go ahead and try it.

label_english:Pottery barn
description_english:Have you brought some hardened clay?
description_success_english:There we are. Now, it's time I instructed you on what lurks below. We will first start with something fairly easy to find and which you don't have to mine far down to get - coal. Coal is a replacement for charcoal as fuel and is used in the making of torches which I believe you have already done. You can also compact nine coal into a block, which is just a little bit more fuel efficient. Let's not waste any more time talking about coal. Mining a little further down and you can find iron. Iron is a very useful material and a staple of any good miner. To mine iron will need a stone pickaxe, a wooden one won't work very well. Once you have mined the iron ore you must refine it into iron ingots in your furnace. Please find some iron and bring me four iron ingots.
description_refuse_english:Iron is a necessary part of any miner's stash.

label_english:Ironing out
description_english:Were you able to mine any iron?
description_success_english:Very good to hear. You are well on your way to becoming a professional miner. Iron can be used to make better versions of any of your normal tools. Further in the underground you will find gold. Not as common, you will have to go pretty far down, but if you hit lava, you went too far. In order to mine gold properly you will need an iron pickaxe. Once you have the gold ore, as with iron, you must refine this into ingots in your furnace. Please bring me four gold ingots.
description_refuse_english:Gold adds a wonderful accent to any building.

description_english:Did you find any gold?
description_success_english:Well done. Please note that with most of these materials you can make a large block of the material which you can then build with by filling your workbench with the material. Now for some emeralds, a material that we find particularly valuable. Emeralds are rare and you can only find then in the extreme hills. You will also need an iron pickaxe to mine them properly. Unlike iron and gold however, no smelting is necessary. Please find me an emerald.

description_success_english:Oh, thank you so much! Oh, you want it back? Oh, ok, you can have it back. Another resource you will find in the underground is lapis lazuli. Like emerald, it does not need rifining in a furnace and requires an iron pickaxe, but thankfully is not confined to just extreme hills. See if you can find some lapis lazuli for me.

description_english:Mine any lapis lazuli recently?
description_success_english:Ahh, lapis lazuli. The bluest stone if I ever saw one. Next, and going a little deeper, all the way down to lava in fact, is redstone. Extremely handy, restone will allow you to automate many things, for you see it carries a charge like electricity. Redstone does not need to be smelted in a furnace and requires an iron pickaxe to mine. Please be carefully with this one and don't fall in the lava.
