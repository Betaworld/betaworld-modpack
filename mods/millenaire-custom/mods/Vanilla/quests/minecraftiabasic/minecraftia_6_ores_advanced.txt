description_english:Welcome back. I do believe it is now time for you to learn about obsidian, for you will need it soon. Obsidian is created when water meets standing lava, and only a diamond pick is strong enough to mine it. Obsidian is strong enough to withstand an explosion from a creeper or TNT. Please bring me four obsidian.
description_success_english:Glad you'll do it even though it's dangerous.
description_refuse_english:Suit yourself.
