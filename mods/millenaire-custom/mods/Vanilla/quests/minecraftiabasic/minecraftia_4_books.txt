label_english:The academics
description_english:Hi there. I'm $startvillager_villagername$, a librarian here. I don't think we've met yet. And now we have. I think it's time for you to start getting some academic knowledge. We should start with making paper. I have heard that you recently found out about sugar cane. Well, there is another use for sugar cane and that is to make paper. To make paper just lay out a row of sugar cane in your workbench. Go find some sugar cane and bring me back some paper.
description_success_english:I'll be waiting.
description_refuse_english:Stay in school.

description_success_english:Books are necessary for your continued study. What to do with books? Make a bookshelf of course! To make a bookshelf place a row of wooden planks along the top of your workbench, a row of wooden planks along the bottom, and finally a row of books through the middle. Do this now and bring to me a bookshelf.

description_english:Did you craft a bookshelf?
description_success_english:Bookshelves will give your home an air of the learned. Now in order to talk about our next project we first need to talk about squid. Squid are creatures that swim around in the ocean and have tentacles. Gentle by nature they won't attack you. However, they posses a precious commodity and that is ink. Once you have ink you can make a book and quill for recording your exploits in writing. To make a book and quill simply place an ink sac in the bottom left of your workbench, a feather directly above it, and lastly a book to it's right. Please go find some squid and bring back a book and quill.
