description_english:I think it's high time you learned to cook your meat. To cook meat, or anything else, you'll need a furnace. To make a furnace just take eight cobblestone and place it in a ring around the edges of your workbench. That's it! Go make a furnace and show me.
description_success_english:Once you do this we can get on to more interesting things.
description_refuse_english:I suppose you don't need a furnace.

description_english:Did you make a furnace yet?
description_success_english:Excellent! The basics of using a furnace are thus - place what you want to cook in the top slot and your fuel in the bottom slot. After a short period of time, you will have a cooked product in the spot on the right. For fuel you can use pretty much anything made of wood, coal, or lava. Now, let's get cooking. Cook some of that raw beef you have and bring me a nice juicy steak.
