label_english:To dye for
description_english:Welcome back. Are you ready to learn about some more ways to beautify your home? Good. I would like to explain dying today. There are various materials that can be used as dyes. Let's start with the simple ones. Cocoa beans can be used as brown dye and ink sacs for black. To dye a piece of wool, just place it in your workbench with the colored dye you want. Can you dye some brown and black wool and bring it to me please?
description_success_english:Dying wool is an art.
description_refuse_english:Not interested? Fine by me.

description_english:Have you dyed any wool brown yet?
description_success_english:Good, you're first colored wool. You can use this for making all kinds of excellent designs. To help with this let's move on to our next colors, yellow and red. Yellow dye is made from the yellow flowers you see dotting the landscape. Just place them in your workbench and you can crush them to make dye. Red dye is made the same way as yellow, only with the red flowers. Please bring me some yellow and red wool.

description_english:Do you have some blue wool for me?
description_success_english:Good. Now before we move on I must tell you how to make white dye, even though you probably don't want to dye anything white. White dye is simply bone meal. That's it. Now let's move on to the more complex dyes. All complex dyes are made by mixing two dyes in your workbench. Orange is red and yellow, cyan is green and blue, purple is red and blue, gray is black and white, light blue is blue and white, pink is red and white, and finally lime is green and white. Please bring me some wool of each color.

label_english:The third degree
description_english:Do you have the magenta and light gray wool?
description_success_english:Good. Now there are other things we can do with dyes. You can make carpet for a nice floor by combine two units of the same color wool together. You can also dye hardened clay by placing some dye in the center of your workbench and eight pieces of hardened clay all around it. I won't ask you to make these though, let's continue. Last tip with dyes. You can use dyes directly on sheep and get colored sheep. Now for some more home decorating advice. Let's start with stone bricks, sandstone, smooth sandstone, and chiseled sandstone. Let's just go through these quick. Stone bricks are made by placing four stone in a square in your workbench. Sandstone is made the same way only with sand instead of stone. Combining sandstone in this same way in your workbench will create smooth sandstone. Finally, taking sandstone slabs and placing two, one above the other in your workbench you can make chiseled sandstone. Make some of each of these and bring them to me.

We'll make a jukebox. A jukebox is made by placing wooden planks in a ring around your workbench, just like a chest, but you place a diamond in the center. Try this now.
