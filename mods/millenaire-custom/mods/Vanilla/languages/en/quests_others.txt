bottleoenchanting_0_description=Hello there, adventurer! Looking for some experience? As the priest of this fair village I am privy to knowledge others are not, which includes how to make bottles o' enchanting. Bring me eight emeralds and I will give you one.
bottleoenchanting_0_description_success=And here is your bottle o' enchanting, good adventurer. A pleasure doing business with you!
bottleoenchanting_0_description_refuse=It's your loss. Another time perhaps?



//main quest line
minecraftia_0_intro_0_label=Adventurer's beginning
minecraftia_0_intro_0_description=Ahh, a new adventurer! Allow me to introduce myself. I am $startvillager_villagername$, chief of this village. This world is a harsh one; allow me to give you some advice. Don't go out at night, that's when the monsters come. If I were you, I would build myself a house. I just request that you do not build it within our village limits. Check the board in the Town Hall to know what we claim as ours. Now, to help you build a shelter for yourself, you will need some tools. Please speak with our Blacksmith and he will get you started.
minecraftia_0_intro_0_description_success=Excellent! Allow me to give you this as a sign of our hospitality. Please go see the blacksmith, he will help you.
minecraftia_0_intro_0_description_refuse=Well then, good luck surviving!

minecraftia_1_tools_0_label=My first tools
minecraftia_1_tools_0_description=Hello adventurer! The village chief, $chief_villagername$ told me you would be paying a visit. Allow me to instruct you on making the tools of survival. Let's start with all important workbench, needed for making tools. To make a workbench, arrange 4 wooden planks in a square.
minecraftia_1_tools_0_description_success=Let me know when you have completed this.
minecraftia_1_tools_0_description_refuse=You won't amount to much without a workbench!.
minecraftia_1_tools_1_label=Let's make a workbench!
minecraftia_1_tools_1_description=Have you created a workbench yet?
minecraftia_1_tools_1_description_success=Very good. Now let's make the all important pickaxe. Take a couple of wooden planks and place them one above the other to make some sticks. Then place one stick in the middle of your workbench. Place another stick below this one. Then take three wooden planks and place them across the top of your workbench. This is the basic way to craft any pickaxe. The wooden planks can be changed out for other materials. Go make a wooden pickaxe now and bring it to me.
minecraftia_1_tools_1_description_refuse=A pickaxe is a man's best friend. Don't leave home without it!
minecraftia_1_tools_1_listing=Make a workbench and show it to the blacksmith
minecraftia_1_tools_2_label=Time to mine
minecraftia_1_tools_2_description=How's that pickaxe coming?
minecraftia_1_tools_2_description_success=Ahh, you have done it! Here, you deserve this stone pickaxe. Next I shall instruct you in making a shovel. As with a pickaxe, place a stick in the middle of the workbench and one below this. Then place a single wooden plank in the top middle of your workbench. Try this and come back to me.
minecraftia_1_tools_2_description_refuse=A shovel is a useful thing. I would keep one around if I were you.
minecraftia_1_tools_2_listing=Make a wooden pickaxe and show it to the blacksmith.
minecraftia_1_tools_3_label=Can you dig it
minecraftia_1_tools_3_description=Do you have a shovel yet?
minecraftia_1_tools_3_description_success=What a fine digging implement! And here is a slightly better, stone one. Now you will need an axe. No one wants to run around punching trees all day. Place sticks in your workbench just like the pickaxe and shovel, then place 3 wooden planks in the top left corner. One in the very top left, one in the top middle, and one in the middle left. Come back to me when you've done this.
minecraftia_1_tools_3_description_refuse=While an axe isn't necessary, it beats punching trees.
minecraftia_1_tools_3_listing=Make a wooden shovel and show it to the blacksmith.
minecraftia_1_tools_4_label=He's a lumberjack and he's okay
minecraftia_1_tools_4_description=Cut down any trees yet?
minecraftia_1_tools_4_description_success=Excellent! Now, cutting trees with wood is rather silly, isn't it. Here's a stone axe for you. I bet you're getting hungry by now. Please go see one of the farmers and they will teach you all about raising crops and food. Or, go see the butcher to learn about livestock.
minecraftia_1_tools_4_description_refuse=Well then starve to death. Won't be the first time an adventurer thought they didn't need to eat.
minecraftia_1_tools_4_listing=Make a wooden axe and show it to the blacksmith.

minecraftia_2_farming_0_label=It's growing season
minecraftia_2_farming_0_description=Hello adventurer! I've been asked to teach you about our local crops and how to plant them. But first, let's talk about hunger and eating. As time passes you will get hungry and need to eat. If too much time passes before you eat your body will be wracked with pain. If you keep yourself with a full belly, all your wounds will heal over time as well. So let's get planting and harvesting food shall we. All food requires land to grow on and water no more than 2 meters away to nourish it. Before you can plant anything however, you need to till the soil to make it acceptable for growing. You'll need to till the soil with hoe. To make a wooden hoe place one stick in the middle of your workbench and the other right below it in the bottom middle. Then take two wooden planks and place one in the the top left corner and one in the the top middle of your workbench. Do this for me now and then we can start planting.
minecraftia_2_farming_0_description_success=Let me know when you have completed this task.
minecraftia_2_farming_0_description_refuse=I understand if farming just isn't for you.
minecraftia_2_farming_1_label=How much for that hoe
minecraftia_2_farming_1_description=Have you a hoe?
minecraftia_2_farming_1_description_success=Good! Here, let me give you this old stone one I found lying around. Now, here are some seeds. Why don't you go and find a spot of land near some water and plant the seeds. Wheat will grow over time once planted and has 8 stages of growth. Once ripened you can harvest it. Come back to me when you have nine wheat.
minecraftia_2_farming_1_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_farming_1_listing=Make a wooden hoe and show it to the farmer.
minecraftia_2_farming_2_label=No pain, no grain
minecraftia_2_farming_2_description=Did you harvest wheat as I instructed?
minecraftia_2_farming_2_description_success=Very good, now we can make some bread with this. You can also make cookies and cake with wheat, but we'll get to that later. Now to make bread, you just take three bunches of wheat and place them in a row, horizontally, in your workbench. Bring me back some bread and we'll move on.
minecraftia_2_farming_2_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_farming_2_listing=Plant and harvest 9 wheat to bring back to the farmer.
minecraftia_2_farming_3_label=The best thing since sliced bread
minecraftia_2_farming_3_description=You didn't eat all that bread did you?
minecraftia_2_farming_3_description_success=Good. Now you won't go hungry. And here's a little something for the road. Now let's learn about another crop, carrots. Carrots grow in the same maner as wheat however you can eat them raw. They don't provide as much nutrition as bread though. Here's a carrot, go turn it into three.
minecraftia_2_farming_3_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_farming_3_listing=Make some bread and bring it to the farmer
minecraftia_2_farming_4_label=Carrot top
minecraftia_2_farming_4_description=You know what likes carrots? Bunnies.
minecraftia_2_farming_4_description_success=Good. Now let's learn about another crop, potatoes. Potatoes grow in the same maner as wheat and carrots however you can eat them raw. They don't provide nearly as much nutrition though and there's a chance you will harvest a bad one. Here's a potato, go turn it into three.
minecraftia_2_farming_4_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_farming_4_listing=Plant and harvest 3 carrots to bring back to the farmer
minecraftia_2_farming_5_label=You say potato, I say potato
minecraftia_2_farming_5_description=Behave yourself now. Potatoes have eyes.
minecraftia_2_farming_5_description_success=Good. You have now learned some of the local crops of our land. A couple of last things before I let you go. I'm sure you've noticed by now that the leaves of trees decay when you chop them down. Sometimes they will drop their seeds in the form of saplings. You can plant these saplings to grow more trees. One more thing. There is a way to make your crops grow faster. If you use bone meal on crops they will grow nigh instantaneously and also allow you to grow flowers on plain grass. Bone meal is made by pulverising bone in your workbench. I think that's it for now. Head over to the butcher's and they'll teach you about cooking.
minecraftia_2_farming_5_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_farming_5_listing=Plant and harvest 3 potatoes to bring back to the farmer

minecraftia_2_livestock_0_label=Raising the barn
minecraftia_2_livestock_0_description=Hello adventurer! I've been asked to teach you about our local livestock and how to raise them. But first, let's talk about hunger and eating. As time passes you will get hungry and need to eat. If too much time passes before you eat your body will be wracked with pain. If you keep yourself with a full belly, all your wounds will heal over time as well. So let's start raising some livestock so we can have some nice meat to eat. We can start with cows. When slaughtered cows provide us with raw beef and leather. You can eat the raw beef, but it doesn't provide much nurishment. Leather has various uses which you will learn about later. If you have a bucket, you can also milk a cow. Milk is used in the baking of cakes and can also cure you of poison. You can breed two cows together, as long as they are in close proximity to one another, by feeding them wheat. After breeding, a cow won't want to breed for a while. Now, here's a couple of bunches of wheat. Go find some cows, breed them, then slaughter the adults and bring me back two raw beef and two leather.
minecraftia_2_livestock_0_description_success=Don't forget to breed first, slaughter second!.
minecraftia_2_livestock_0_description_refuse=Squimish are we?
minecraftia_2_livestock_1_label=Beef! It's what's for dinner!
minecraftia_2_livestock_1_description=Do you have the beef and leather?
minecraftia_2_livestock_1_description_success=Excellent! Our next animal we raise for food is the pig. Pigs are bred by feeding them carrots and are slaughtered for raw pork. Raw pork is just about as healthy as raw beef. Again, we'll get into cooking later. Now go get me some pork!
minecraftia_2_livestock_1_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_livestock_1_listing=Bring 2 raw beef and 2 leather to the butcher
minecraftia_2_livestock_2_label=Pork. The other white meat.
minecraftia_2_livestock_2_description=Everything's better with bacon.
minecraftia_2_livestock_2_description_success=Good! Now for our final food bearing animal, the chicken. Raw chicken does not satiate your hunger by any meaning of the word, and it's possible to become poisoned when eating it. Best to cook it first. Chickens will also give up their feathers at times, which can be used for crafting some useful items that I won't get into here. The last unique thing to understand about chickens is that they lay eggs. As with milk from cows the eggs are used in baking cakes. Eggs have another purpose however. If smashed a baby chicken might pop out. Oh, and before I forget, you can breed chickens with seeds. Bring me one egg, two feathers, and three pieces of raw chicken.
minecraftia_2_livestock_2_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_livestock_2_listing=Bring 3 raw porkchops to the butcher
minecraftia_2_livestock_3_label=Tastes like chicken
minecraftia_2_livestock_3_description=How goes the chicken hunt?
minecraftia_2_livestock_3_description_success=Very good. I have a few more animals that we raise to tell you about. These are animals that we don't raise for their food, but they are useful for other things. First is the sheep, raised for it's wool. Like cows, sheep are bred with bunches of wheat. When slaughtering a sheep you can remove the wool, however there is a better way. If you have a pair of shears you can remove the wool without harming the sheep. Furthermore, you can use various dyes on living sheep to make sheep grow wool of all kinds of different colors. We'll teach you about crafting shears and making dyes later. For now, please bring me three white wool.
minecraftia_2_livestock_3_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_livestock_3_listing=Bring 3 raw chicken, 2 feathers, and 1 egg to the butcher
minecraftia_2_livestock_4_label=It's a wooly situation
minecraftia_2_livestock_4_description=The sheep is the one that goes 'baaa'.
minecraftia_2_livestock_4_description_success=Well done. Now we will go into horses and their variations, Donkeys and Mules. Horses and Donkeys can be found in most Plains type areas grazing on the grass there. Taming a horse or donkey is a delicate process of letting the animal to get to trust you. You must find a wild one and hop on it's back. Now it won't trust you at first and it will throw you off. But keep trying as after a little while it will come to accept you. Once you have some tamed horses or donkeys they can be bred with golden apples or golden carrots, which you will learn about much later. Speaking of breeding, if you breed a horse with a donkey you can get a mule. In fact, it's the only way to get a mule. One nice thing to mention about donkeys and mules is their ability to carry your belongings on long journeys if you strap a chest to them. Oh, and if your horse ever gets damaged, just give it some hay bales and it will feel much better. Hay bales are made by filling your workbench ful of wheat. Why don't you go make a hay bale now and bring it to me.
minecraftia_2_livestock_4_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_livestock_4_listing=Bring 3 pieces of white wool to the butcher
minecraftia_2_livestock_5_label=Time to bale
minecraftia_2_livestock_5_description=Bundled any hay bales recently?
minecraftia_2_livestock_5_description_success=Good. Come and see me when you're ready and I will teach you about cooking.
minecraftia_2_livestock_5_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_2_livestock_5_listing=Bring a hay bale to the butcher

minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_0_label=They go bump in the night
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_0_description=I'm sure you've noticed by now that it is not safe at night. That's when the monsters come out. So let's talk a little bit about the monsters and how you can protect yourself from them. Let's start with zombies. Zombies are slow and like brains, specifically, yours. Anything they find lying on the ground they will pick up and attempt to beat you with it until you are dead so they can get at your brains. They only come out at night or lurk in dark caves. They will burn in the daylight, but seem to have figured out that jumping in water or wearing something on your head will protect them from that. Killing a zombie will give you their rotten flesh, which you can eat in a pinch, but it will poison you. They also may still have some things they had in life on them, such as carrots, iron, potatos, tools, weapons, or armor. That's it for zombies. Now for skeletons. Like zombies, they only come out at night or lurk in dark caves, burn in the daylight, and have found protection from it the same way. The one key difference about skeletons, despite their lack of brains, is that they use bows and arrows. Best to either stay at a distance or charge in fast. When a skeleton is destroyed you can grab his bones and some of those arrows they were using. You may also be able to take their bows and armor, if not in too bad of shape. Next up, spiders. As with the previous two, spiders come out at night and creep around caves. However, they don't burn in the daylight but they do become docile. Spiders can also climb, so don't forget to look up! By slaying a spider you can obtain some of their silk string and their eyes. Rarely, you will find a skeleton riding a spider; we call them spider jockeys. More dangerous then either a skeleton or spider alone, they shoot arrows, are fast, and can climb. Next is a very dangerous creature, the creeper. They are so named as they will creep up behind you and explode, harming both you and the landscape. If you manage to see one before it explodes, you will notice that they flash and grow a bit bigger. This means that an explosion is imminent; back off and give the creeper some space to calm down. Like spiders, creepers come out at night, creep around caves and do not burn in the daylight. When killed without a self sacrificing explosion, they will yeild up the source of their explosiveness, gunpowder. Lastly, we have the endermen. Like all previous they only come out at night and hide in caves. They don't burn in the daylight, however they don't like it and will try to find shade as soon as possible. Water harms them, so you tend to not see them when it's raining. They are a creature of magic and maytery and seem to have an inferiority complex about their face as they won't attack unless you look directly at their face. Their mystical powers allow them to teleport and they like to take bits of the landscape and move them around or just teleport away with it. No one really knows what they do with it. If you manage to kill one you can take their mystical enderpearls.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_0_description_success=Well that was a whole lot of information to take in. I'll give you a minute and then we can talk about weapons and armor.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_0_description_refuse=Without protection from these creatures you won't live long.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_1_label=That's not a knife
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_1_description=Absorb all that information yet?
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_1_description_success=Now, you must be asking yourself, "Isn't there a better way to kill these monsters than punching them?" Yes, of course there is! With swords and bows. Let's start with swords. To make a sword, place one stick in the bottom middle of your workbench and a wooden plank in each space right above it. As with other tools you can change the wooden planks out for different types of materials. Go make a wooden sword and bring it to me.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_1_description_refuse=Fine, punch everything to death.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_1_listing=Speak with the blacksmith to learn about weapons and armor
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_2_label=This is a knife!
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_2_description=Crafted a sword yet?
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_2_description_success=There you have it! Here's a stone sword for you. Now let's make a bow and some arrows. You can craft a bow by placing three pieces of string vertically along the right side of your workbench then adding three sticks in a triangle pointing left. Arrows are made by placing a stick in the center of the workbench, a feather below it, and a piece of flint above it. Flint can be obtained rarely by digging out gravel. Now, go and slay some spiders and make a bow and some arrows!
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_2_description_refuse=Without a bow you'll just make things harder for yourself.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_2_listing=Make a wooden sword and bring it to the blacksmith
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_3_label=Take a bow
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_3_description=Have you crafted a bow and some arrows?
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_3_description_success=Excellent! And here's some extra arrows for you. Now that you have learned about weapons, let's enhance your survival with some armor. We're going to start with leather armor, although there are different materials that can be used. We'll start with something for your head. To make a helmet place five peices of leather in your workbench like so: three pieces horizontally across the top and one underneath each side in the left middle and right middle spots. Show me that you can make a leather cap.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_3_description_refuse=Fine, don't be protected.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_3_listing=Make a bow and 4 arrows and bring them back to the blacksmith
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_4_label=Fancy hats
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_4_description=Did you make a leather cap?
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_4_description_success=Very good. Now the next piece of armor is the chestplate. To make a chestplate place three peices of leather horizontally along the bottom of your workbench, three pieces along the middle, and one each at either end of the top of the workbench. That's eight leather total. Go now and do this.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_4_description_refuse=Fine, don't be protected.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_4_listing=Make a leather cap and show it to the blacksmith
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_5_label=A dashing suit
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_5_description=How's that leather tunic coming along?
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_5_description_success=Good. Feeling better about staying alive? Next we shall make some leggings. To make leggings take three peices of leather and place them vertically along the right, three pieces vertically along the left, and one piece in the top middle. That's seven leather total. Come back to me when your finished.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_5_description_refuse=Fine, don't be protected.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_5_listing=Make a leather tunic and bring it to the blacksmith
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_6_label=Rock star pants
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_6_description=Do you have some pants yet?
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_6_description_success=Well done. Last but not least are boots. Boots take the least amount of material to make at only four pieces. To make them, place two pieces of leather vertically, along the bottom right side of your workbench and two pieces vertically, along the bottom left side. Show me what you can do.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_6_description_refuse=Fine, don't be protected.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_6_listing=Make some leather pants and show them to the blacksmith
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_7_label=Dancing shoes
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_7_description=Have you made leather boots yet?
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_7_description_success=Ahh, you now have the knowledge you need to survive, at least for a while. One last tidbit about armor. Now, you may not have tamed any yet, but horses can wear armor too, but only if made of a harder material than leather. Unfortunately, the expertise to craft this armor has been lost to the ages however their may still be peices of it scattered around the temples and dungeons. Well, that's it. Come and see us again some time.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_7_description_refuse=Fine, don't be protected.
minecraftia_3_armor_and_weapons_7_listing=Make some leather boots and show them to the blacksmith

minecraftia_3_general_0_label=The house decorator
minecraftia_3_general_0_description=Why, hello $name. You know what you need? You need a nice, warm bed to come back to after a hard day of adventuring. A bed will help you pass the night away, and should anything horrible happen to you, give you a place to start again. Let me help you make one. Just take three wooden planks and lay them across the bottom of your workbench. Then take three pieces of wool and lay them horizontally across the workbench right above the wooden planks. There, that's it! Now you try.
minecraftia_3_general_0_description_success=A bed is where the home is.
minecraftia_3_general_0_description_refuse=Well then be forever without rest.
minecraftia_3_general_1_label=A nice, warm bed
minecraftia_3_general_1_description=Did you make a bed yet?
minecraftia_3_general_1_description_success=Good to hear. Your house will be homey in no time! Now let's get some lighting in there. To start with take a stick and put a piece of coal or charcoal above it in your workbench. Oh, if you haven't spoken to the blacksmith yet he will explain all about ores, which is what coal would be. And if you haven't spoken to the butcher yet about cooking you can make charcoal by burning logs in a furnace. The light from torches will help keep the monsters away. Go ahead and make some torches and bring them back to me.
minecraftia_3_general_1_description_refuse=You wish to walk around in the dark?
minecraftia_3_general_1_listing=Make a bed and bring it to the chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_2_label=Let there be light
minecraftia_3_general_2_description=Have you some torches?
minecraftia_3_general_2_description_success=Excellent! Now you can place those on most surfaces, like you see around our village. And here's a little extra to get you started. There are other methods of lighting, but we won't get into those just yet. Let's talk about other things to beautify your home. How about slabs? Slabs are a block of material that will allow you to go up and down inclines without jumping. They are crafted by placing three of the material you want along the bottom of your workbench, horizontally. Why don't you make some wooden slabs for me?
minecraftia_3_general_2_description_refuse=A home should be a work of art.
minecraftia_3_general_2_listing=Make 4 torches and show them to the chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_3_label=Two halves make a whole
minecraftia_3_general_3_description=Did you craft some wooden slabs for me?
minecraftia_3_general_3_description_success=Well done. I bet your house will look great. You can make these slabs with a variety of different materials; you should experiment and find out which ones. Now, I bet you've noticed the stairs leading into almost all our buildings. Stairs, like slabs, allow you to go up and down inclines without jumping. Let's make some stairs. You can make them out of any material you can use for slabs. To make stairs place six of the same material in a triangle formation against the right and bottom of your workbench. The three spots in the upper left should be empty. Go ahead and make me four oak wooden stairs.
minecraftia_3_general_3_description_refuse=Escher would be disappointed in you.
minecraftia_3_general_3_listing=Make 6 wooden slabs and bring them to the chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_4_label=The stairs to nowhere
minecraftia_3_general_4_description=Are stairs making your life easier yet?
minecraftia_3_general_4_description_success=Very good. Now you have probably collected many things and your backpack is probably getting full. I think you need somewhere to put it all. Time to make a chest. To make a chest just place eight wooden planks around all the sides of your workbench, leaving the middle spot free. Make chest for your things now.
minecraftia_3_general_4_description_refuse=Well then carry everything you own around.
minecraftia_3_general_4_listing=Make 4 wooden stairs and bring them to the chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_5_label=A chest of things
minecraftia_3_general_5_description=Did you build a chest?
minecraftia_3_general_5_description_success=Good. Now you don't have to carry anything around. If you place two chests next to each other on the ground they will form a bigger, single chest. Now let's put a sign up so everyone know's where your house is. To make a sign place three wooden planks horizontally across the top of your workbench and three horizontally across the middle. Then place a single stick in the bottem center. Please bring me some signs.
minecraftia_3_general_5_description_refuse=Signs are useful, but I guess you don't think so.
minecraftia_3_general_5_listing=Build a chest and take it to the village chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_6_label=The writing on the wall
minecraftia_3_general_6_description=Have you crafted a sign yet.
minecraftia_3_general_6_description_success=Good. Signs are useful for all kinds of things. Now let's get you a door for your house. To make a door just place three wooden planks vertically along the left side of your workbench and three vertically down the center. You can also make a door out of iron. Let's start with a wooden door.
minecraftia_3_general_6_description_refuse=You won't be saying that when the zombies eat you in your own home.
minecraftia_3_general_6_listing=Craft 3 signs and show the chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_7_label=One door opens
minecraftia_3_general_7_description=Did you craft a door yet?
minecraftia_3_general_7_description_success=There it is. Having a door will make keeping out monsters easier. Now say you want to make a second story to your house or get up somewhere when you don't have a lot of space. You need a ladder. To make a ladder just place seven sticks in an 'H' formation in your workbench. Bring some ladders to me.
minecraftia_3_general_7_description_refuse=Take the long way up then.
minecraftia_3_general_7_listing=Craft a door for the chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_8_label=To the top
minecraftia_3_general_8_description=How's the ladders coming?
minecraftia_3_general_8_description_success=Now you can reach high places or make a second floor to your house. Now let's make some fences to keep your animals in. Fences are great because they're light weight and can't be jumped over. To make a fence just take three sticks and place them along the bottom of your workbench horizontally and three more sticks along the middle row, horizontally. Make some fences are bring them here.
minecraftia_3_general_8_description_refuse=Whatever suits your fancy.
minecraftia_3_general_8_listing=Craft 3 ladders for the cheif's wife
minecraftia_3_general_9_label=Always good to have a fence
minecraftia_3_general_9_description=Did you make some fences?
minecraftia_3_general_9_description_success=Now those pesky critters won't run away. You can also make fences out of cobblestone. But sometimes you're going to want to enter your fenced off area. For that you'll want a fence gate. So how do you make a fence gate you ask? Well just take two sticks and place them in the bottom and middle left spots of your workbench, then two more sticks in the bottom and middle right spots, and lastly place two wooden planks in between these. Let's make one now.
minecraftia_3_general_9_description_refuse=Good luck getting in and out.
minecraftia_3_general_9_listing=Craft 2 fences and bring them to the cheif's wife
minecraftia_3_general_10_label=Shut the gate
minecraftia_3_general_10_description=Do you have a fence gate yet?
minecraftia_3_general_10_description_success=Isn't that nice. Now you can get into your animal pen with ease. Let's do something to cover those wide open holes in your floor left by the ladders. Let's make a trapdoor for them. To make a trapdoor, just place three wooden planks along the bottom of your workbench and then three wooden planks in the middle row of your workbench. Go make a few trapdoors and bring them to me.
minecraftia_3_general_10_description_refuse=Well if that's your decision then.
minecraftia_3_general_10_listing=Craft a fence gate and show the chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_11_label=It's a trap
minecraftia_3_general_11_description=Have you made some trapdoors yet?
minecraftia_3_general_11_description_success=There you go; no more accidentally falling down ladders or other holes. Let's decorate the home a bit more. To do that we'll hang some paintings on the walls. Paintings are made by placing a piece of wool in the very center of your workbench and then eight sticks all around the outside of it. Let me see what you can do.
minecraftia_3_general_11_description_refuse=You life will forever be without art.
minecraftia_3_general_11_listing=Make 2 trapdoors to bring to the village chief's wife
minecraftia_3_general_12_label=A work of art
minecraftia_3_general_12_description=Do you have a painting to show me?
minecraftia_3_general_12_description_success=Now won't that just brighten up your house. Similarly you can hang various other things on your walls with item frames. An item frame is made the same way as a painting, except instead of wool in the center it's a piece of leather. Once you hang it on a wall you can put something in it. Why don't you make me and item frame now?
minecraftia_3_general_12_description_refuse=No trophies to hang yet?
minecraftia_3_general_12_listing=Make a painting and show the chief's wife your skills
minecraftia_3_general_13_label=Frame it on the wall
minecraftia_3_general_13_description=Have you crafted an item frame?
minecraftia_3_general_13_description_success=Look at that. Now you can hang all your trophies on the wall. Well, I think that's all I have for you right now. Come back and see me again some time.
minecraftia_3_general_13_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_3_general_13_listing=Construct an item frame and bring it to the chief's wife

minecraftia_3_cooking_0_label=Burning down the house
minecraftia_3_cooking_0_description=I think it's high time you learned to cook your meat. To cook meat, or anything else, you'll need a furnace. To make a furnace just take eight cobblestone and place it in a ring around the edges of your workbench. That's it! Go make a furnace and show me.
minecraftia_3_cooking_0_description_success=Once you do this we can get on to more interesting things.
minecraftia_3_cooking_0_description_refuse=I suppose you don't need a furnace.
minecraftia_3_cooking_1_label=A box of fire
minecraftia_3_cooking_1_description=Did you make a furnace yet?
minecraftia_3_cooking_1_description_success=Excellent! The basics of using a furnace are thus - place what you want to cook in the top slot and your fuel in the bottom slot. After a short period of time, you will have a cooked product in the spot on the right. For fuel you can use pretty much anything made of wood, coal, or lava. Now, let's get cooking. Cook some of that raw beef you have and bring me a nice juicy steak.
minecraftia_3_cooking_1_description_refuse=You won't get any pudding unless you eat your meat!
minecraftia_3_cooking_1_listing=Construct a furnace and bring it to the butcher
minecraftia_3_cooking_2_label=I'll have the T-bone
minecraftia_3_cooking_2_description=Did you cook up some steak?
minecraftia_3_cooking_2_description_success=Good, good. Let's do the same with some raw porkchops and raw chicken.
minecraftia_3_cooking_2_description_refuse=Fine, keep eating raw, unhealthy food.
minecraftia_3_cooking_2_listing=Cook a piece of raw beef for the butcher
minecraftia_3_cooking_3_label=Porkchops and chicken
minecraftia_3_cooking_3_description=Have you cooked some porkchops and chicken yet?
minecraftia_3_cooking_3_description_success=Well done. That takes care of cooking meat. Now say you want some vegitables to go along with that meat. Go grab some potatoes and cook them to make some baked potatoes.
minecraftia_3_cooking_3_description_refuse=Steak and potatoes, how could you go wrong?
minecraftia_3_cooking_3_listing=Cook a piece of raw pork and raw chicken for the butcher
minecraftia_3_cooking_4_label=With a side of butter
minecraftia_3_cooking_4_description=How are those baked potatoes?
minecraftia_3_cooking_4_description_success=Good. Now I think you're all set with cooking food. Go and see the blacksmith for more about using the furnace.
minecraftia_3_cooking_4_description_refuse=Ok, suit yourself.
minecraftia_3_cooking_4_listing=Cook a potato for the butcher

minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_0_label=The wild ones
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_0_description=Learning a lot? Good. Now I wanted to let you know about some more exotic crops that you will sometimes see around. Let's start with sugar cane. Sugar cane grows next to water and can be up to four meters tall. When harvesting, you only need to take the top part; you can leave the bottom planted and it will continue to grow again. Sugar cane can be refined into sugar by using your workbench. Sugar is used in making pies and cakes. We don't grow it here in the village so I don't have any to show you. Could you find some for me? And then maybe bring me some sugar?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_0_description_success=Thanks for going out of your way to find this for me.
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_0_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_1_label=Sugar baby
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_1_description=Did you manage to find some sugar cane?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_1_description_success=Oh you found some sugar cane. How nice. We'll make use of it later. Our next exotic ingredient is cocoa. Cocoa gows on the sides of jungle trees, and as you can see, we don't have a cocoa farm. Cocoa beans are used in making cookies, so if you bring me some I can make you cookies. Cookies are made by placing one bundle of wheat, one cocoa bean, and another bundle of wheat all in a row in your workbench. Can you find some cocoa and make some cookies for me?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_1_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_1_listing=Bring one sugar cane and one unit of sugar to the farmer
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_2_label=Cookie monster
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_2_description=Do you have cookies?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_2_description_success=I think cocoa is the best tasting crop there is. Here's some extra cookies for you. Let's move on to pumkins and melons. Pumpkins and melons need water to grow but they don't grow like wheat, potatoes, or carrots. When planting a pumpkin or melon make sure to leave some dirt next to it as it will grow a stem and drop the fruit in an adjacent spot. Pumpkins can be made into pie when placed in a workbench with sugar and an egg. You can also dig out the seeds of pumpkins and melons using your workbench. See if you can find some pumpkins and make me a pie.
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_2_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_2_listing=Bring some cocoa beans and 8 cookies to the farmer
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_3_label=Eat a Pi
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_3_description=Did you bake a pie for me?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_3_description_success=There's always time for pie. Now let's talk about some food you can forage. Apples are a good snack to tide you over while hunting in the woods. They will fall rarely from oak trees. If you want to harvest apples, try planting an oak tree farm. Can you find me an apple?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_3_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_3_listing=Bring one pumpkin pie to the farmer
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_4_label=An apple a day
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_4_description=Find any apples?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_4_description_success=Oh, you found some; look at that! There's one more crop I think you should know about. Mushrooms. Mushrooms grow in dark caves and shady areas in swamps and jungles. There are two kinds of mushrooms, red and brown. You can make mushroom stew by taking one each of these mushrooms and crafting them with a bowl at your workbench. A bowl is made with three wooden planks placed in a 'V' shape at your workbench. Can you go forage some mushrooms and make a stew?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_4_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_4_listing=Bring one apple to the farmer
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_5_label=Fungus among us
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_5_description=Did you cook me up some mushroom stew?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_5_description_success=A nice bowl of stew. Your food knowledge is coming along nicely. Now I'd like to explain cactus farming to you. Cacti are not for eating but they do have other uses. As you might have guessed, cacti only grow in desert on sand. They also have prickly spines which will harm you, or anything else, if you run into them. This makes them a good replacement for fences if you are only concerned about keeping things out. The proper way to farm cacti is on sand with nothing else on any side of them - they need their space. Can you find a desert and bring back some cactus for me?
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_5_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_3_farming_advanced_5_listing=Bring a bowl of mushroom stew to the farmer

I think it's time for you to start getting some academic knowledge. We should start with making paper. I have heard that you recently found out about sugar cane. Well, there is another use for sugar cane and that is to make paper. To make paper just lay out a row of sugar cane in your workbench. Go find some sugar cane and bring me back some paper.
minecraftia_4_books_0_description_success=I'll be waiting.
minecraftia_4_books_0_description_refuse=Stay in school.
minecraftia_4_books_1_label=Press the fibers
minecraftia_4_books_1_description=Have you made some paper yet?
minecraftia_4_books_1_description_success=Ahh, you have successfully made some paper! Now, what can we do with this paper? Let's start with making books. To make a book place a piece of leather in the bottom left corner of your workbench and then three pieces of paper right around it. Could you make me a book now?
minecraftia_4_books_1_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_4_books_1_listing=Bring 3 sheets of paper to the librarian
minecraftia_4_books_2_label=Read a book
minecraftia_4_books_2_description=Do you have a book for me?
minecraftia_4_books_2_description_success=Books are necessary for your continued study. What to do with books? Make a bookshelf of course! To make a bookshelf place a row of wooden planks along the top of your workbench, a row of wooden planks along the bottom, and finally a row of books through the middle. Do this now and bring to me a bookshelf.
minecraftia_4_books_2_description_refuse=You'll be back.

minecraftia_4_books_3_description_success=Bookshelves will give your home an air of the learned. Now in order to talk about our next project we first need to talk about squid. Squid are creatures that swim around in the ocean and have tentacles. Gentle by nature they won't attack you. However, they posses a precious commodity and that is ink. Once you have ink you can make a book and quill for recording your exploits in writing. To make a book and quill simply place an ink sac in the bottom left of your workbench, a feather directly above it, and lastly a book to it's right. Please go find some squid and bring back a book and quill.

minecraftia_4_fishing_0_label=To teach a man
minecraftia_4_fishing_0_description=Ahh, $name. I'm going to teach you how to fish. But before you can catch fish you will of course need a fishing rod. To create a fishing rod place three sticks diagonally in your workbench and then two pieces of string hanging down from the top stick.  Go make yourself a shiny new fishing rod.
minecraftia_4_fishing_0_description_success=It'll feed you for life.
minecraftia_4_fishing_0_description_refuse=You'll want one sooner or later.
minecraftia_4_fishing_1_label=Some sticks and string
minecraftia_4_fishing_1_description=Did you create a fishing rod yet?
minecraftia_4_fishing_1_description_success=Great! Now we can start fishing. To fish, just cast your line in any body of water. When you see the bobber go down and back up again that means you have a fish on your line. Quick as you can reel it back in. Go catch me a few fish.
minecraftia_4_fishing_1_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_4_fishing_1_listing=Craft a fishing rod and show it to the farmer
minecraftia_4_fishing_2_label=Sashimi time
minecraftia_4_fishing_2_description=Have you caught some fish?
minecraftia_4_fishing_2_description_success=Excellent. Now, raw fish really aren't that healthy, so let's cook it. You cook fish just like beef, chicken, and porkshops. Why don't you cook off that fish you have now?
minecraftia_4_fishing_2_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_4_fishing_2_listing=Catch 4 fish for the farmer
minecraftia_4_fishing_3_label=Fishsticks
minecraftia_4_fishing_3_description=Is the fish ready?
minecraftia_4_fishing_3_description_success=Very good. Cooked fish will provide you with more sustanence than raw fish. Finally, I want to teach you about boats, which you can fish from or just take a lazy stroll down the river. To make a boat just place five wooden planks in your workbench in a 'U' shape. Let's make a boat now.
minecraftia_4_fishing_3_description_refuse=You'll be back.

minecraftia_4_ores_0_label=It's gettin' hot in here
minecraftia_4_ores_0_description=Now that you've learned about cooking with a furnace it's time to learn what else we can use it for. We're going to talk about smelting materials. Let's start with making charcoal so you don't ever run out of fuel. To make charcoal just burn any wood log in your furnace. Bring to me eight charcoal.
minecraftia_4_ores_0_description_success=Glad you'll do it. You'll never run out of fuel.
minecraftia_4_ores_0_description_refuse=Suit yourself.
minecraftia_4_ores_1_label=Fuel for the fire
minecraftia_4_ores_1_description=Do you have the charcoal I asked for?
minecraftia_4_ores_1_description_success=Very well, on to smelting materials. The first material to speak about is stone. I'm sure you have been mining out stone recently to get cobblestone for building and such. Well, you can take that cobblestone and refine it back into stone by smelting it in your furnace. Go do this and bring me eight stone.
minecraftia_4_ores_1_description_refuse=You'll be missing out.
minecraftia_4_ores_1_listing=Bring 8 charcoal to the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_2_label=Pounding stone
minecraftia_4_ores_2_description=How is smelting working for you?
minecraftia_4_ores_2_description_success=Good. Now let's move on to a more complex material - glass. Glass is made by smelting sand. Carefull when digging out sand though, it could fall and crush you. Please bring me eight glass.
minecraftia_4_ores_2_description_refuse=Don't need windows?
minecraftia_4_ores_2_listing=Take 8 stone to the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_3_label=Broken glass
minecraftia_4_ores_3_description=Have you smelted the glass yet?
minecraftia_4_ores_3_description_success=Excellent. Now, let's make using glass more econimical. If you place one row of glass in the bottom of your workbench and one row glass in the middle, you can craft glass panes. Please bring me sixteen glass panes.
minecraftia_4_ores_3_description_refuse=Glass panes look nicer and are more econimcal. What's not to love?
minecraftia_4_ores_3_listing=Bring 8 glass to the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_4_label=A window to the sun
minecraftia_4_ores_4_description=Did you craft some glass panes yet?
minecraftia_4_ores_4_description_success=Very good. Now on to a rarer building material, clay. Clay can be found on the bottom of rivers. As such, be carefull when digging it up as you wouldn't want to drown now would you? Once you have some clay you'll have to smelt it into bricks. Find some clay and bring me eight bricks please.
minecraftia_4_ores_4_description_refuse=I know it's dangerous, but you'll see it's worth the risk.
minecraftia_4_ores_4_listing=Bring 16 glass panes to the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_5_label=Bakin' brick
minecraftia_4_ores_5_description=Have you baked some brick yet?
minecraftia_4_ores_5_description_success=Nice to see. Now, let's take those bricks and make something we can actually build with. In your workbench, place four bricks in a square. This will make a brick you can use for building. Bring me a brick.
minecraftia_4_ores_5_description_refuse=Bricks make for a nice looking house.
minecraftia_4_ores_5_listing=Take 8 brick to the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_6_label=Layin' brick
minecraftia_4_ores_6_description=Did you craft the bricks I asked for?
minecraftia_4_ores_6_description_success=Good job. Now your house will look amazing. Another thing you can do with clay is sculpt four balls of it into a block and then fire it in your furnace. This will give you some hardened clay. Go ahead and try it.
minecraftia_4_ores_6_description_refuse=I didn't realize this task was so hard.
minecraftia_4_ores_6_listing=Craft a block of bricks for the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_7_label=Pottery barn
minecraftia_4_ores_7_description=Have you brought some hardened clay?
minecraftia_4_ores_7_description_success=There we are. Now, it's time I instructed you on what lurks below. We will first start with something fairly easy to find and which you don't have to mine far down to get - coal. Coal is a replacement for charcoal as fuel and is used in the making of torches which I believe you have already done. You can also compact nine coal into a block, which is just a little bit more fuel efficient. Let's not waste any more time talking about coal. Mining a little further down and you can find iron. Iron is a very useful material and a staple of any good miner. To mine iron will need a stone pickaxe, a wooden one won't work very well. Once you have mined the iron ore you must refine it into iron ingots in your furnace. Please find some iron and bring me four iron ingots.
minecraftia_4_ores_7_description_refuse=Iron is a necessary part of any miner's stash.
minecraftia_4_ores_7_listing=Fire a block of clay in a furnace for the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_8_label=Ironing out
minecraftia_4_ores_8_description=Were you able to mine any iron?
minecraftia_4_ores_8_description_success=Very good to hear. You are well on your way to becoming a professional miner. Iron can be used to make better versions of any of your normal tools. Further in the underground you will find gold. Not as common, you will have to go pretty far down, but if you hit lava, you went too far. In order to mine gold properly you will need an iron pickaxe. Once you have the gold ore, as with iron, you must refine this into ingots in your furnace. Please bring me four gold ingots.
minecraftia_4_ores_8_description_refuse=Gold adds a wonderful accent to any building.
minecraftia_4_ores_8_listing=Smelt 4 iron ingots for the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_9_label=Precious, my precious
minecraftia_4_ores_9_description=Did you find any gold?
minecraftia_4_ores_9_description_success=Well done. Please note that with most of these materials you can make a large block of the material which you can then build with by filling your workbench with the material. Now for some emeralds, a material that we find particularly valuable. Emeralds are rare and you can only find then in the extreme hills. You will also need an iron pickaxe to mine them properly. Unlike iron and gold however, no smelting is necessary. Please find me an emerald.
minecraftia_4_ores_9_description_refuse=Money is the color green.
minecraftia_4_ores_9_listing=Smelt 4 gold ingots for the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_10_label=The color green
minecraftia_4_ores_10_description=Any luck finding emeralds?
minecraftia_4_ores_10_description_success=Oh, thank you so much! Oh, you want it back? Oh, ok, you can have it back. Another resource you will find in the underground is lapis lazuli. Like emerald, it does not need rifining in a furnace and requires an iron pickaxe, but thankfully is not confined to just extreme hills. See if you can find some lapis lazuli for me.
minecraftia_4_ores_10_description_refuse=I'm blue, da ba dee da ba die...
minecraftia_4_ores_10_listing=Bring one emerald to the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_11_label=A gem of the ocean
minecraftia_4_ores_11_description=Mine any lapis lazuli recently?
minecraftia_4_ores_11_description_success=Ahh, lapis lazuli. The bluest stone if I ever saw one. Next, and going a little deeper, all the way down to lava in fact, is redstone. Extremely handy, restone will allow you to automate many things, for you see it carries a charge like electricity. Redstone does not need to be smelted in a furnace and requires an iron pickaxe to mine. Please be carefully with this one and don't fall in the lava.
minecraftia_4_ores_11_description_refuse=Restone is nothing to play around with if you don't know what you're doing.
minecraftia_4_ores_11_listing=Take 3 lapis lazuli to the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_12_label=A charge in the air
minecraftia_4_ores_12_description=Find any redstone?
minecraftia_4_ores_12_description_success=And there it is! A librarian can tell you more about redstone and machinery. Lastly, we have diamond. Diamond is the rearest material you can find mining in the undergound, but also very useful. It will produce the strongest protecting armor around. Maybe it's asking too much, but could you find some diamond?
minecraftia_4_ores_12_description_refuse=Good luck to you.
minecraftia_4_ores_12_listing=Take 4 smaples of redstone to the blacksmith
minecraftia_4_ores_13_label=A girl's best friend

minecraftia_4_ores_13_description_success=I must say that I did not expect this. Very well done. Now, off with you. You have much adventuring that must be done.
minecraftia_4_ores_13_description_refuse=Diamonds are the best. None for you I guess.

I hear that you have been delving deep into the underground and uncovering the mysteries of the world. I would like to issue a word of warning on what you might find below and above the ground. Ancient temples, possible built by the enders and holding old ender power. Underground you will find ancient dungeons with monsters bound by ender power. Monsters will continuously pour from the dungeon unless completely lit in an eight meter radius or by destroying it.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_0_description_success=I have much more to teach you, don't wander far.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_0_description_refuse=Good luck to you then.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_1_label=The ancient tomb
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_1_description=Let's talk some about the old tombs in the desert. It is unknown whose tombs they are, but I do know that whomever they were did not want to be disturbed. For you see, they trapped their tombs. Careful when plundering those tombs.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_1_description_success=I will teach you more, if you will listen.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_1_description_refuse=You'll be missing out.

minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_2_label=The temple in the trees
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_2_description=I must speak to you about the ancient temples in the jungle. Raised to an unknown god, it is said the people that built them kept treasures within. But don't be hasty, they kept their treasures well protected. Try not to die.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_2_description_success=There is more to tell, come speak with me again some time.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_2_description_refuse=I will see you again.

minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_3_label=A house in the swamp
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_3_description=Have you noticed any huts in the swamps? Those are where the witches live. Outcasts of society, they live alone in swamps, brewing evil potions. They tend to carry the materials of their trade with them in case they need a quick fix. I would advise you to stay clear of them until you are well prepared.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_3_description_success=Keep up the good work. There is more to teach.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_3_description_refuse=As you wish.

minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_4_label=They go squish
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_4_description=Welcome back. Moving right along, another denizen of the swamps are slimes. They are rarely seen there though. You are more likely to encounter them anywhere underground. Careful when fighting them however, as when you knock chuncks off of them the chunks will still live until they get too small to sustain themselves. Squishing a slime will give you a slimeball, which have various interesting uses.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_4_description_success=Beware the green goo.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_4_description_refuse=You don't know what you're missing.

minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_5_label=Iron man
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_5_description=Hello again. Today I wish to speak with you about another protector of the people, he iron golem. Unlike creatures of this world they do not naturally exist in the wild, they must be created. It is unknown who created the first iron golem, however the knowledge has been passed on through the ages. Iron golems will wander around and attack anything hostile that comes near them. To create an iron golem you will need much iron. As I'm sure the blacksmith already informed you, iron ingots can be compressed into one large block of iron by filling your workbench with the ingots. You will need four of these large blocks of iron. To make the body of an iron golem, place one iron block on the ground, one directly on top of the first, and one each on opposite sides of the second. It should look like a standing 'T' of iron. Now to breath life into the golem, just place a pumpkin on top of it all as the head. Voila! New life!
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_5_description_success=Iron golems will wander, so fencing in the area you want them to protect is not unheard of.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_5_description_refuse=The mysteries of life do not intrigue you?
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_5_listing=Speak to the priest about iron golems
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_6_label=The snowman
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_6_description=Good to see you still around. I would like to tell you about another golem, the snow golem. Like the iron golem, it is unknown who first created them, but we do know how to create more. To create a snow golem, place a block of snow on the ground and a second block just above it. Once again, place a pumpkin on top to give it life. Snow golems will wander around slowly, leaving trails of snow behind and will melt in water. They will also throw snowballs at hostile creatures to help defend you.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_6_description_success=Snow golems will protect you best in an area where there is much snow.
minecraftia_4_monsters_advanced_6_description_refuse=Good luck to you.

minecraftia_5_farming_master_0_label=The cake is a lie
minecraftia_5_farming_master_0_description=I have a few more bits of food knowledge to pass on to you. That is how to make cakes, gold apples, and enchanted golden apples. Cake will fill you up very well, however it is not really a food for on the go. You must eat it one slice at a time off of your prefered dining surface. To make a cake place three buckets of milk across the top of your workbench, three bunches of wheat along the bottom, an egg in the center, and one each of sugar in the remaining two spots. Please bake me a cake.
minecraftia_5_farming_master_0_description_success=Good to see you still alive.
minecraftia_5_farming_master_0_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_5_farming_master_1_label=Let them eat cake
minecraftia_5_farming_master_1_description=Have you baked a cake yet?
minecraftia_5_farming_master_1_description_success=Very good. Golden apples, now, are a bit on the expensive side. To make a golden you will need eight gold ingots. Place the apple in the center of your workbench and the eight gold ingots surrounding it. It might be expensive, but it's well worth it if you can afford it. Now enchanted golden apples are even hard to produce but they will magically heal your wounds. To make an enchanted golden apples, place an apple in the center of your workbench, with eight blocks of gold all around it. I'm not going to ask you to do this, as you may never find enough gold for the job, but if you do, bring me an enchanted golden apple please. Well, as I said earlier this is the end of all I have to teach you. You are hereby a food master. We will meet again.

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_0_label=To dye for
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_0_description=Welcome back. Are you ready to learn about some more ways to beautify your home? Good. I would like to explain dying today. There are various materials that can be used as dyes. Let's start with the simple ones. Cocoa beans can be used as brown dye and ink sacs for black. To dye a piece of wool, just place it in your workbench with the colored dye you want. Can you dye some brown and black wool and bring it to me please?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_0_description_success=Dying wool is an art.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_0_description_refuse=Not interested? Fine by me.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_1_label=Is it chocolate?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_1_description=Have you dyed any wool brown yet?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_1_description_success=Good, you're first colored wool. You can use this for making all kinds of excellent designs. To help with this let's move on to our next colors, yellow and red. Yellow dye is made from the yellow flowers you see dotting the landscape. Just place them in your workbench and you can crush them to make dye. Red dye is made the same way as yellow, only with the red flowers. Please bring me some yellow and red wool.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_1_description_refuse=Dying wool is an art.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_1_listing=Bring a piece of black and a piece of brown wool to the chief's wife

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_2_description=Do you have the red and yellow wool?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_2_description_success=Good. Now let's move on to green. Green dye is made by burning cactus in your furnace. Bring me some green wool.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_2_description_refuse=Dying wool is an art.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_2_listing=Bring a piece of red and a piece of yellow wool to the chief's wife

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_3_description=Have you some green wool?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_3_description_success=Good, on to blue. So like brown and black, you can just use lapis lazuli as blue dye. Go make some blue wool now.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_3_description_refuse=Dying wool is an art.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_3_listing=Bring a piece of green wool to the chief's wife

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_4_description=Do you have some blue wool for me?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_4_description_success=Good. Now before we move on I must tell you how to make white dye, even though you probably don't want to dye anything white. White dye is simply bone meal. That's it. Now let's move on to the more complex dyes. All complex dyes are made by mixing two dyes in your workbench. Orange is red and yellow, cyan is green and blue, purple is red and blue, gray is black and white, light blue is blue and white, pink is red and white, and finally lime is green and white. Please bring me some wool of each color.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_4_description_refuse=Dying wool is an art.

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_5_description=Do you have wool of all the colors I asked?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_5_description_success=Very good. We are almost done with dyes. There are just two more colors. Magenta is made with purple and pink dye. Finally, light gray is made with gray and white. Please make some magenta and light gray wool.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_5_description_refuse=Signs are useful, but I guess you don't think so.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_5_listing=Bring a piece of orange, cyan, purple, gray, light blue, pink, and lime green wool to the chief's wife

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_6_description=Do you have the magenta and light gray wool?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_6_description_success=Good. Now there are other things we can do with dyes. You can make carpet for a nice floor by combine two units of the same color wool together. You can also dye hardened clay by placing some dye in the center of your workbench and eight pieces of hardened clay all around it. I won't ask you to make these though, let's continue. Last tip with dyes. You can use dyes directly on sheep and get colored sheep. Now for some more home decorating advice. Let's start with stone bricks, sandstone, smooth sandstone, and chiseled sandstone. Let's just go through these quick. Stone bricks are made by placing four stone in a square in your workbench. Sandstone is made the same way only with sand instead of stone. Combining sandstone in this same way in your workbench will create smooth sandstone. Finally, taking sandstone slabs and placing two, one above the other in your workbench you can make chiseled sandstone. Make some of each of these and bring them to me. 
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_6_description_refuse=Tired of crafting yet?

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_7_description=How goes the sand crafting?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_7_description_success=Good to see you've done it. Now let's add some more accents to your home. Iron bars add a nice little touch. Theya are created by placing one row of iron ingots along the bottom of your workbench and one row in the middle of your workbench. Please bring me some iron bars.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_7_description_refuse=Very well then.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_7_listing=Bring a piece of sandstone, 4 stone bricks, 4 smooth sandstone, 1 chiseled sandstone to the chief's wife

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_8_description=Did you make those iron bars?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_8_description_success=Excellent. Note that iron bars are not like fences. They wont keep monsters out nor your animals in. Next we have flower pots, which you can plant flowers in. Flower pots are made by placing three bricks in a 'V' in your workbench. Make me a flower pot please.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_8_description_refuse=Whatever suits your fancy.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_8_listing=Bring 16 iron bars to the chief's wife

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_9_description_success=Now your flowers will have a place, won't that just brighten up your house? Let's move on to jack-o-lanterns. Jack-o-lanterns are made by combining a pumpkin and a torch in your workbench. Won't you bring me a jack-o-lantern?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_9_description_refuse=As you will.

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_10_description=Did you make a jack-o-lantern?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_10_description_success=The nice thing about jack-o-lanterns is that pumpkin protects the torch from water so you can use them for light under the ocean. Now let's get fancy. We'll make a jukebox. A jukebox is made by placing wooden planks in a ring around your workbench, just like a chest, but you place a diamond in the center. Try this now.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_10_description_refuse=Well if that's your decision then.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_10_listing=Make a jack-o-lantern for the chief's wife

minecraftia_5_general_advanced_11_description=Have you crafted a jukebox?
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_11_description_success=Excellent. Now, how do you play music with it? Well, in dungeons you will sometimes find music discs, but I have heard that creepers carry them but only if a skeleton destroys them. Who knew creepers were a fan of music? Anyway, we'll meet again sometime.
minecraftia_5_general_advanced_11_description_refuse=Music is the joy of life.

minecraftia_5_machines_0_label=We have the technology
minecraftia_5_machines_0_description=Hello again. It's time you learned about redstone all that it can do. We're going to start small. Redstone is a mineral that can carry a charge and power machines. A simple, and very useful device that redstone can power is a compass. A compass will allow you to find your way back to your home. To make a compass place some redstone in the center of your workbench and four iron ingots in a cross around it. Bring a compass to me.
minecraftia_5_machines_0_description_success=I'll be waiting.
minecraftia_5_machines_0_description_refuse=Stay in school.
minecraftia_5_machines_1_label=To find your way
minecraftia_5_machines_1_description=Have you made a compass yet?
minecraftia_5_machines_1_description_success=Excellent, you're first redstone powered device! Let us now make a similarly useful device - a clock. A clock will allow you to tell what time of day it is while in the dark caverns underground. To make a clock place a piece of redstone in the center of your workbench, and four pieces of gold in a cross around it.
minecraftia_5_machines_1_description_refuse=You'll be back.

minecraftia_5_machines_2_description_success=Good. Let us continue in our quest for easier exploration. Next we have maps. A map is created by placing a compass in the center of your workbench and then eight paper in a ring around it. Maps will fill in their area as you walk around. Please bring me a map.
minecraftia_5_machines_2_description_refuse=You'll be back.

minecraftia_5_machines_3_label=Map it all
minecraftia_5_machines_3_description=Have you a map for me to see?
minecraftia_5_machines_3_description_success=Now, one interesting thing you can do with a map is make it cover a bigger area. To do this, place the map in the center of your workbench and surround it with eight pieces of paper. You can do this up to four times to create ever increasing map sizes. That's all for exploration and survival for now. Next we have kind of an oddball but it helps in mining quickly. We're going to make TNT. TNT is made by placing five gunpowder in an 'X' in your workbench and then four sand sand in the empty slots. Can you make me a piece of TNT?
minecraftia_5_machines_3_description_refuse=You'll be back.
minecraftia_5_machines_3_listing=Draw a map for the librarian
minecraftia_5_machines_4_label=It's dynomite!
minecraftia_5_machines_4_description=How's that TNT coming along?
minecraftia_5_machines_4_description_success=Good. Now you can blow all kinds of things to smitherines. To set off the TNT just lite it with some flint and steel. You'll have a few seconds before it blows, so run when you do. It's time to talk about easy long distance travel. Minecarts and their rails can get you from place to place rather quickly, but you'll of course need to lay the rails first. There are some abandoned mines with rails in the underground, but be careful, they are infested with spiders. Let's make a minecart and some rails. To make a minecart just place five iron ingots in a 'U' shape in your workbench. To make some rails place three iron ingots in the left column of your workbench, three iron ingots in the right column, and a single stick in the center. Please make a minecart and some rails.
minecraftia_5_machines_4_description_refuse=You'll be back.

minecraftia_5_machines_5_description=Did you build a minecart and rails?
minecraftia_5_machines_5_description_success=Excellent. Once you place rails on the ground you can place a minecart on the tracks and get from place to place faster. Keep in mind that a minecart won't move on it's own, you'll have to push it a little or take it down an incline. Now we can put some intesting things in minecarts. You can put a chest in a minecart to transport goods from one location to another without having to walk there. To make a minecart with a chest, just place the minecart and a chest in your workbench. We can also put a furnace or TNT in a minecart in the same way. Please make a minecart with a chest, one with a furnace, and one with TNT.

Normally they are peaceful creatures, but if aggrivated they will defend themselves. I'm sure you've already realized this. But did you know, that with a little coaxing, you tame them?

The ocelot lives in jungles and will run at the sign of any human. To coax them into approaching, you must proceed very slowly and they very much like raw fish. While they are extremely scared of everything, there is one thing that is scared of them, creepers. Creepers will not approach an ocelot and may in fact flee at the sight of one. You'll do well to catch one or two. Lastly we have the mooshrooms. Mooshrooms have only ever really been rumored of - they may no longer exist - but I'll tell you anyway. It is said that they inhabit far off islands with strange redish grass where only mushrooms grow. It is claimed by some that mooshrooms even have mushrooms growing on their back and can be milked for mushroom stew! Can you believe it? Well let me tell you, adventurer, it is all true!

Nobody really understands how to make name tags anymore and they can only be found in dugeons, Left by some ancient people. I believe that it is because ther is power in a name and it may be tied to the soul so ther might be some ender power in there. However, if you do manage to find a name tag you can give it a name with your Anvil and then give that name to any pet you have.

Now I already know you've been told you can use shears to get wool from sheep more efficiently, but there are other things you can use shears for. Shears will allow you to prune leaves, vines, ferns, dead bushes, and tall grass and remove cobwebs with ease. Shears are made by placing one inron ingot in the bottom left corner of your workbench and one iron ingot in the middle of your workbench. Bring me some shears.

minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_0_label=Laying the signal
minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_0_description=Hello again, $name. Let's get into the more advanced machines but first we need some background. Now we're going to talk about laying redstone and making redstone circuits to power a multitude of devices. You can place redstone directly on the ground to form wires to carry it's charge long distances. But by itself it won't generate a charge. So let's learn about all the different methods of delivering a charge to redstone wire. To generate a charge you will need one of the following items - buttons, pressure plates, levers, redstone torches, tripwire hooks, and weighted pressure plates. Let's make all of these now. A button is the simplest and it is crafted by just placing a bit of stone or wooden planks in your workbench. Buttons can be placed on walls and when pressed will generate a charge. Pressure plates are made by placing two pieces of stone or wooden planks next to each other in the workbench. Pressure plates can be placed on the ground and generate a charge when stepped on. Levers are crafted by placing a stick above a piece of cobblestone in your workbench. Levers can be placed on a wall or ground and will generate a charge as long as they are flipped, unlike buttons and pressure plates which just generate a brief charge. Redstone torches will also create a constant charge. They are made by placing a piece of redstone on top of a stick in your workbench, like a normal torch. Next we have the tripwire hook. To use tripwire hooks you will need two of them placed in a straight line from each other and connected with string. They send out a charge when someone walks through and breaks the string. To make a tripwire hook place an iron ingot, a stick, and a wooden plank, top to bottom in a column in your workbench. Lastly the weighted pressure plates are much like regular pressure plates except only items dropped on them will activate them. They are also made the same except using either iron or gold ingots. Please make a wooden button, a wooden pressure plate, a lever, a redstone torch, two tripwire hooks, and finally an iron weighted pressure plate for me.

minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_1_description=Did you craft all of the different switches I asked?
minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_1_description_success=Good. Now you can create all kinds of circuts and traps. I would just like to take a moment to mention that doors can be powered to open and close with a redstone charge, however iron doors can only be opened with a redstone charge. Now, the charge of redstone wire only lasts for about sixteen meters. To make the signal go further you can use a redstone repeater. To make a repeater place three stone in the bottom row of your workbench, then a redstone torch on each side, with a piece of redstone in the center. Please make a redstone repeater.

minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_2_description_success=Good. Now let's make some different kinds of rails that generate redstone signals and are powered by redstone signals, detector rails and powered rails. Detector rails will generate a redstone signal when a laden minecart runs over it. A detector rail is made by placing one column of iron ingots on the left of your workbench, one on the right, a stone pressure plate in the center, and finally some redstone in the bottom middle. A powered rail will propel a minecart forward if it is powered with a redstone signal. To make a powered rail place a column of gold ingots on the left of your workbench, a column of gold ingots on the right, a stick in the center, and a piece of redstone in the bottom middle. Could you make me some detector and powered rails?

minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_3_description_success=Good. On to some devices that can be powered by redstone signals. The note block is the first of these. When a note block receives a restone signal it will play a note. By putting many of these in series you can make music. To make a note block place wooden planks in a ring around your workbench and a piece of redstone in the center. Go ahead and make a note block now.

So it will fire arrows or dump buckets of water or lava. To make a dispenser place cobblestone in an 'n' shape inyour workbench, with a bow in the center and a piece of redstone below it. Please make a dispenser.

minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_5_description_success=Good. Dispensers are useful for making traps. Now we have the piston. When supplied with a redstone charge, a piston will push another piece of solid material. Sometimes this isn't all that helpful though. Building on a piston is the sticky piston. A sticky piston will push material, but it will also pull that material back in place, which tends to be far more useful. To make the piston place a row of wooden planks across the top of your workbench, two pieces of cobblestone on the left side, two cobblestone on the right side, an iron ingot in the center, and a piece of redstone in the bottom middle. To make it into a sticky piston you'll need a slimeball. Slimeballs come from slimes of course, which you can find sometimes deep underground. Can you make me a sticky piston?

minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_6_description_success=Good. I'm sure you will find many uses for pistons and sticky pistons. Now we have the trapped chest. While a trapped chest doesn't inherently have any trap attached to it, it does generate a redstone signal when opened, most often used to set off a trap. A trapped chest is made by placing a regular chest in the middle of your workbench and a tripwire hook directly to the left. Please make a trapped chest.

minecraftia_6_machines_advanced_7_description_success=Good. Next up is a hopper. A hopper will take items placed into it and transfer them to a container below it. This could be a chest or a furnace or some other container device. A hopper will also take items from a container placed above it, like a chest or the output of a furnace. If placed on the side of a furnace it will place suitable items in the fuel slot. A hopper can be turned off by giving it a redstone signal. Hoppers can also be placed in minecarts the same as chests, furnaces, and TNT. To make a hopper, place a chest in the middle of your workbench, an iron ingot in the top left, middle left, top right, middle right, and bottom middle. Please bring me a hopper.

minecraftia_6_mysteries_0_description=Welcome back, $name. You are turning out to be someone to keep an eye on. It is time you were told about some of the deeper mysteries of this place. There is one mystery that we have gleamed from the enders, and that is how to capture some of their power into objects. We call this enchanting. To enchant your weapons and armor you will need what we call an enchantment table. To make an enchantment table, place three obsidian along the bottom of your workbench, one obsidian in the center, a diamond to each side of this obsidian, and finally a book on top. Let's see if you can create this mystery.
minecraftia_6_mysteries_0_description_success=We shall see you in time.
minecraftia_6_mysteries_0_description_refuse=It is up to you, adventurer.
minecraftia_6_mysteries_1_label=A transfer of power
minecraftia_6_mysteries_1_description=Have you crafted an enchanting table?
minecraftia_6_mysteries_1_description_success=Well done, $name! Now I bet you want to know how to actually perform enchanting. Enchanting power into an object requires transferring something of yourself to the object. By itself, an enchanting table won't be able to transfer much energy. To increase how much energy an enchanting table can transfer it needs to draw on other knowledge. Placing bookshelves around the enchanting table will accomplish this. Now, to enchant armor or weapons just place what you want to enchant on the left side of the enchanting table and just select how much knowledge you want to transfer. This is rather uncontrolled as you never know what the power you have transferred will coalesce into. There is a more controlled way to do this. You can enchant a book using the uncontrolled enchantment table, then take that newly enchanted book and transfer the enchantment to a weapon or armor using an anvil. I must warn you, this second transfer will cost you more of yourself, but allows you to pick and choose what you ultimately want. Another ender mystery I must speak to you about is the use of the pearls endermen carry. If you take an ender pearl and throw it, you will be instantaneously transported to the place it lands. I only mention this now that I have taught you about enchanting. For you see, instantaneously transferring from place to place does not come without cost. It will harm you. However, there exist enchantments that can lessen the impact. What they are is not within my knowledge, you will have to figure this out on your own. I believe you are perfectly capable of this. We will speak of more mysteries at another time.

minecraftia_7_machines_master_0_label=The signal goes round and round
minecraftia_7_machines_master_0_description=Hello again, $name. I have been hearing that you are learning about The Nether. Fasinating place, isn't it? Anyway, we can use some materials from there in creating some more powered devices. Now I'm sure you've noticed some glowing material that hangs down from the roofs of caverns in The Nether. That is called glowstone. When you harvest glowstone, you will get glowstone dust. Useful for all kinds of things, for our purpose we want to remould it into a solid piece of glowstone. To do this, just make a square of glowstone dust in your workbench. Now that we have some solid glowstone again, we are going to make a lamp with it. Place the newly formed glowstone in the center of your workbench and four redstone in a cross shape around it. This will produce a redstone lamp. A redstone lamp will turn on when it receives a redstone signal and off again when there is no supply. Bring me a redstone lamp.

minecraftia_7_machines_master_1_description_success=Good to see. Next we'll make something a little more complicated, called the redstone comparator. A redstone comparator will take in two redstone signals, one from the back, and one from the side, and produce a single signal out the front. A redstone comparator is made by placing three pieces of stone along the bottom row of your workbench, a piece of nether quartz in the very center, two redstone torches to either side of it, and another redstone torch above it. Please bring me a redstone comparator.

minecraftia_7_machines_master_2_description_success=Good. Complex circuits, here we come! Our last redstone powered device is a daylight sensor. A daylight sensor does just what it's name implies. It senses the level of light in the area and will send out a redstone signal of which the strength of that signal varies based on the light level. Brighter light is a stronger signal and total darkness is no signal at all. To make a daylight sensor, place three wooden slabs along the bottom row of your workbench, three pieces of glass along the top row, and fill the center row with nether quartz. Please make a daylight sensor.

minecraftia_7_machines_master_3_description_success=Good. Now you can create circuits that take action based on the time of day. We have only one more thing to speak about. I am going to teach you how to make fireworks. There are a multitude of different fireworks that you can make. Let's start with the basic firework. A basic firework will simply shoot up into the sky. To make a simple firework just place a piece of paper in the center of your workbench and some gunpowder right below it. This is so simple that I think we can move on from it. So let's start augmenting this simple firework. To increase the duration, you can add more gunpowder in the bottom left and bottom right of the workbench. Easy, right? Now we're going to add a firework star. Once crafted you will place the firework star above the piece of paper in the workbench. To craft a firework star you will always need some gunpowder in the top left corner of your workbench and some dye placed below it for color. You can then add a third ingredient to the right of the gunpowder. To add a color trail to the firework, use a diamond. To add a twinkling effect, use some glowstone dust. To change the shape of it's explosion, add a fire charge for a larger sphere, a gold nugget for a star shape, a feather for a bursting shape, or a monster head to make a creeper shape. Once a firework star is created you can then add even more colors by placing the firework star in the center and the new colored dye below it. Have fun experimenting with fireworks. I can now say that you, $name, have all the knowledge to be a master of all things mechanized. Good luck to you out there.

minecraftia_7_nether_0_label=The fire beyond
minecraftia_7_nether_0_description=We meet again, $name. It is time for you to delve into the place of fire and death. We call this place, The Nether. Perhaps it is a differnt plane of existence running parallel to this one, or an alternate dimension, it is unclear. But we do know how create a gateway between these two worlds and you must have this knowledge as well, adventurer, if you are to succeed in your destiny. To create a Nether Portal, you will need fourteen obsidian. With the obsidian, create a standing doorway frame, four wide by five tall. Once you have completed this, light the inside of the frame on fire. If done correctly a portal will appear within the frame. Standing in this gateway will transport you to The Nether. Let me now warn you of what to expect on the other side. Inside The Nether there are vast lakes and falls of lava, large black as night fortresses where creatures of fire and death roam freely, and the other denizens are just as horrific. Let us take each of these vile creatures and analyze them. Zombie pigmen are the most numerous denizen of The Nether. A vile hybrid of pigs and zombies, they are peaceful at heart, but they won't hesitate to destroy you if you harm one of them. As they hunt in packs, if one member of the group is wounded, all of them will chase you down for revenge. They also have a penchant for gold. They carry golden swords and gold nuggets. Gold nuggets have a varity of uses. Firstly you can compress them into gold ingots by filling your workbench with them and secondly you can make a glistering melon by placing a melon slice in the center of your workbench and eight gold nuggets in a ring around it. We will talk about some of its other uses later, when it is more relevant. The next resident of The Nether to be wary of is the ghast. Ghasts are incredibly large, fly, and shoot fireballs, which can destroy softer materials. If you actually manage to kill one, it may drop one of it's tears. Now we have the magma cube. Magma cubes seem to be a cousin of our slimes, thus suggesting a common evolutionary ancestor or maybe they are slimes corrupted by ender power. It is unknown. When turned to paste you can collect some of thier left over magma cream. Next there are blazes. Blazes inhabit the nether fortresses, can fly, and will shoot fire at you. When slain, you can collect the core of their being, a blaze rod. Pulverizing the blaze rod in your workbench will produce blaze powder. Blaze powder has a number of uses,one of which is creating fire charges. Fire charges can be thrown to shoot fire, much like the blazes themselves. To craft a fire charge, place a piece of coal in the center of your workbench, some blaze powder to the left of it, and some gunpowder below it. Next, we have the wither skeleton. Wither skeletons are much larger than the undead we see here and carry large swords. The also inhabit the nether fortresses. Upon being destroyed, you can collect their heads as a trophy. Lastly we have what some call a ruler of The Nether, the Wither. A Wither can be summoned by placing Soul Sand (which we'll get to later) in a standing 'T' shape on the ground, then placing three wither skeleton heads on top. Do not take this creature lightly! If you manage to survive and kill this creature, within it's body you will find a nether star. There is only one use for a nether star, to my knowledge, and that is in the creation of beacons. Beacons, when placed on a pyramid of iron, gold, emerald, or diamond, will emit a beam of light. Once this is done, feeding the beacon one of these materials will give you a powerful advantage as long as you stay near it. The larger the pyramid, the further away you can be before it's effects wear off. To craft a beacon, place a row of obsidian on the bootom of your workbench, a row of glass along the top, the nether star in the center, and a piece of glass to etiher side of it. That is all for the denizens of that horrid place. Please bring me the spoils of your adventuring there - a gold nugget, a ghast tear, some magma cream, a blaze rod, and a wither skeleton head.

minecraftia_8_brewing_0_description=Hello my good friend, $name. You have gained much knowledge in your time here. Now, do you remember the witches I spoke about some time ago and their evil potions. Well, I think you must learn how to make some good helpful potions for yourself. To do this you will need some equipment - a brewing stand, a cauldron, and some glass bottles. We'll take the brewing stand first. It is comprised of three cobblestone along the bottom row of your workbench and a single blaze rod in the middle. Now the cauldron is made by placing seven iron ingots in a 'U' shape in the workbench. Finally, we have glass bottles which are made by placing glass in a 'V' shape in your workbench. Please make a brewing stand, a cauldron, and some glass bottles.

Now to use a brewing stand to brew potions you will place bottles with water or another potion along the bottom and the ingredient you want to distill in the top. The cauldron will hold water for you to fill up your bottles with. Now, all helpful potions start off with distilling nether wart into water. Nether wart is a plant that only grows natively in The Nether on soul sand. See if you can obtain some soul sand, nether wart, and brew an awkward potion.

minecraftia_8_brewing_2_description=Have you brewed an awkward potion?
minecraftia_8_brewing_2_description_success=Good. This is only the first step. On it's own an awkward potion will have no effect. To make a potion with any effect you must distill one of eight ingredients into your awkward potion. A golden carrot, which is made by placing a carrot in the center of a ring of gold nuggets, will make a potion of night vision. Magma cream, made by combining slimeballs with blaze powder, will create a potion of fire resistance. Sugar will distill into a potion of swiftness speed. A glistering melon, will give you a potion of healing. A spider eye will distill into a potion of poison - this is not recommended, by the way. A ghast tear will distill into a potion of regeneration. A fermented spider eye, made by combining a mushroom, sugar, and a spider eye, will distill into a potion of weakness - also not recommended. And finally, blaze powder will distill into a potion of strength. Most of these potions can then be modified again by distilling redstone, glowstone dust, or a fermented spider eye into them. Redstone will increase the duration, glowstone dust will increase the potency, and a fermented spider eye will corrupt it, changing the potion into a new one. Experiment with different combinations and see what you can get. I will see you in the again in the future.

minecraftia_9_the_end_0_description=Welcome back yet again, $name. Our time together is quickly coming to a close. I wish to reveal to you the last of the mysteries I have knowledge of. Do you remember the ender pearls I spoke to you about and how they have strange power? Well, you can unlock even more power within them. By combining an ender pearl with blaze powder you can create an eye of ender. With this newly unlocked power you can create a special kind of chest that is linked to others of it's kind over any distance or across dimensions. To make these ender chests, place the eye of ender in the center of your workbench and eight obsidian in a ring around it. Show me this mystery.
minecraftia_9_the_end_0_description_success=I shall wait for you.
minecraftia_9_the_end_0_description_refuse=It is up to you, adventurer.

minecraftia_9_the_end_1_description=Have you crafted an ender chest?
minecraftia_9_the_end_1_description_success=Very good. I must now inform you of another place that I have only heard of in passing. They call it The End. I have heard of only one way to reach there. Throwing those eyes of ender to the sky, it is said they will fly in the direction of the last ender strongholds. Within the stronghold is a portal, guarded by small creatures that hide in rock called silverfish. It is said that to activate the portal more eyes of ender must be placed within it's frame. Once you pass through this portal I cannot say what you will find as I do not know of any that have returned. Well, you now have all of the knowledge you need to master this world. Good luck adventurer and let me know what you find at The End. For more information please see - www.minecraftwiki.net
